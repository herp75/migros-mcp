 *
 * **Rate-limit handling (429 Too Many Requests):**
 *
 * - If the session carries an active rate-limit cooldown (`rateLimitedUntil` in
 *   the future), we **never** attempt silent OAuth or full login. Instead we
 *   fail‑open when the cached JWT is still valid or throw a clear error.
 * - A 429 from silent OAuth is **not** cascaded into full login because they
 *   share the same host (`login.migros.ch`) and the same Cloudflare throttle.
 * - After a successful refresh the cooldown is cleared automatically.
 *
 * Persists the session to disk after any refresh so subsequent calls are fast.
 *
 * Throws if `creds` is missing AND no cookies are cached (first-time install
 * with no env vars set).
